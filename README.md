# TapGuide
A free automatic itinerary planner for travellers

## Why Should Travellers Use TapGuide?
TapGuide reduces the overhead needed to plan out a perfect day. Instead of hunting yelp for 3 restaurants and a few activities to do, this app gathers them all into one place. If you find a trip you like, you can save it to your phone.
